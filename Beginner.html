        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is
            a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example,
            a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
            environment to provide programmatic control over them. JavaScript contains
            a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core
            set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and
            statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
            supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
            <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>

      <h1>
        Hello World

      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>

    <h1>
      Variables
    </h1>
    <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules. A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase). You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

      <legend>Declaring The Keywords</legend>
      <pre>With the keyword var. For example,

                        
        var x = 42.
    

This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.By simply assigning it a value. For example,

    
        x = 42
    

This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.With the keyword let. For example,

    
        let y = 13.
